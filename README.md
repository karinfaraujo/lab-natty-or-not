# 🧠 Natural or Fake Natty? — Data Analytics Edition

## 📒 Description
This project explores the **“Natty or Not”** concept applied to **Data Analytics**, questioning how far Artificial Intelligence can go in replacing, supporting, or enhancing human analytical work.

Using a simulated dataset and an interactive dashboard, the project compares **human analysts versus AI-driven analysis**, evaluating metrics such as accuracy, execution time, insights generated, and error rates.

The goal is to provoke a key reflection:  
👉 *Is AI replacing analysts — or empowering them?*
