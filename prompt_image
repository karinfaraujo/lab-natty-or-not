A futuristic data analyst workspace, half human and half artificial intelligence. 
On one side, a human analyst working with a laptop and dashboards, on the other side, an AI hologram analyzing floating data charts. 
The environment looks clean, modern and professional, with data visualizations, charts, KPIs, and neural network patterns.
Cinematic lighting, realistic style, high detail, tech aesthetic, corporate analytics mood.
The concept represents the question: "Is this analysis human or AI generated?"
